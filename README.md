# Bogusly

A script that hands out random +1 bonuses to people you share bonusly with.

## Why?!

Because I can? Also when you don't use your allowance at the end of the month, it disappears, so why not?

## Prerequisites

1. A Read/Write API key from bonusly
2. Python 2.7.x

## Setup

Replace the API key placeholder and set "dryrun" equal to "False."
If you want to see examples of reasons and how it works, you can leave "dryrun" to "True" and it won't submit any bonuses.

This comes with some example "starters," "enders," and "tags" files which are usable out of the box. Feel free to replace them with your own or add on to these lists. I will be accepting merge requests (as long as your contributions are work-safe and not terribly offensive).

## Running

```
chmod +x ./bogusly.py
./bogusly.py
```

That was hard.
